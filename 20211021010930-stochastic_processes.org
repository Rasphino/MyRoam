* Common Types of Stochastic Processes
** Discrete-State and Continuous-State Processes
#+begin_eg
If the number of possible values is finite or countable, the process is called a discrete-state process. For example, the number of jobs in a system $n(t)$ can only take discrete values 0, 1, 2, .... Therefore, $n(t)$ is a discrete-state process. The waiting time $w(t)$, on the other hand, can take any value on the real line. Therefore, $w(t)$ is a continuous-state process.

A discrete-state stochastic process is also called a *stochastic chain*.
