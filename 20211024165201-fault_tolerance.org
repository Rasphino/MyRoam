#+title: Fault Tolerance

* Motivation
- Being able to tolerate fault is itself a motivation for distributed systems
- Tolerating failures are even more important in distributed systems than in non-distributed systems
  + Failures are the norm instead of exception: with many machines, almost always some of them will fail

* Failure Models
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       d0348a82-1637-450c-9125-fc46fef7d5e5
:END:
- Nodes
  + Crash failure
  + Byzantine failure

- Communication channels
  + No failures: reliable message delivery
  + unreliable: may drop messages

* Timing Models
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       c00c0176-c7a8-4e74-93b9-f489301fa1b5
:END:
- Synchronous model
  1. Message delay is bounded and is known
  2. Node processing speed is guaranteed
  3. Can achieve accurate failure detection

- Asynchronous model
  1. Message delay is unbounded and node speed is not guaranteed
