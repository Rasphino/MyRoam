#+title: RAID

*Redundant Arrays of Independent Disks (RAIDs)* are commonly used t oaddress the performance and reliability issues of disk.

* RAID Levels

[[file:images/RAID_Levels/_20211026_104821screenshot.png]]

- Raid 0: drive arrays with striping at the level of blocks but without any redundancy
- Raid 1: drive mirroring
- Raid 4: memory-style ECC organization
- Raid 5: block-interleaved distributed parity, differs from level 4 in that it spreads data and parity among all $N + 1$ drives
- Raid 6: P + Q redundancy scheme, is much like RAID level 5 but stores extra redundant information to guard against multiple drive failures
- Raid 0+1 & 1+0
