#+title: Semaphore

*Semaphores*, like [[id:3cbc58a6-966a-4e72-bbc1-9ee9926f732a][mutex locks]], can be used to provide mutual exclusion. However, whereas a mutex lock has a binary value that indicates if the lock is available or not, a semaphore has an integer value and can therefore be used to solve a variety of synchronization problems.
