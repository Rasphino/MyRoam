#+title: Distributed Consensus

*Distributed consensus* is a very basic building block that allows nodes in a system to agree on something.

| Crash failures; Reliable channels; Synchronous     | Deterministic for $n \geq f + 1$                                 |
| No failures; Unreliable channels; Synchronous      | Impossible (Randomized algorithm with $\frac{1}{r}$ error prob.) |
| Crash failures; Reliable channels; asynchronous    | Impossible (the FLP theorem, no termination guarantee)           |
| Byzantine failures; Reliable channels; Synchronous | If $n \leq 3f$, impossible; Otherwise, deterministic             |
