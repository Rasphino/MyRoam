#+title: Control-Flow Integrity

Definition: each control transfer jumps to a statically known set of locations

* Return edges
Problem: A function can have several callers
Solution: Use a shadow stack


* CFI Implementation with Randomized Tags
Put some bytes (tag) on the beginning of the jump target
Tag should be random and secret
If =f= can jump to block =g= and =h=, then blocks =g= and =h= should have the same tag
