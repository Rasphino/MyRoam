Rust is a multi-paradigm, high-level, general-purpose [[id:524436da-d5f8-4e87-b1e0-16a888eb5761][programming language]] designed for performance and safety, especially safe concurrency. Rust is syntactically similar to C++, but can guarantee memory safety by using a borrow checker to validate references. Rust achieves memory safety without garbage collection, and reference counting is optional.
