Mean number in the system = arrival rate * mean response time

#+NAME: eqn:little's_law
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
E[n] &= \lambda E[r] \\
E[n_q] &= \lambda E[w]
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

* Prerequisite
The number of jobs entering the system is equal to those completing service

* TODO Proof
Suppose monitor the system for a long time period $T$ and keep log of arrival and departure times of each individual job. Because $T$ is large, the number of arrivals would be approximately equal to the departures, let this number be $N$. Then:
\[ \text{Arrival rate} = \text{total arrivals} / \text{total time} = N/T \]
